# Project Name: 01-Node Ecosystem

**Authors**: Wyatt Pefley.
**Version**: 1.0.0
## Overview
During this lab, I created two methods: `arithmetic.add` and `arithmetic.sub`,These methods are used to add numbers and subtract numbers respectively. In addition, I also wrote tests for these methods to ensure the quality of my code. I also modularized my code to adhere to the speraration of concerns idea and to keep a clean and tidy codebase.

## Getting Started
1. Fork original repo on the Code Fellows GitHub.
2. Clone the repo onto your local machine in order to link it to GitHub.
3. Read over the instructions in order to understand what you are being asked to do. 
4. Create methods for adding and subtracting.
5. Write if statements to prevent invalid entries.
6. Write tests for the methods in order to save time debigging and to better understand what you need to do.

## Architecture
### Languages Used: 
1. JavaScript (ES6)
### Frameworks Used:
1. Node JS 
2. Jest

## Change Log
4:00 - Forked the original repo and cloning it to our local machines
4:20 - If statement to prevent an invalid entry. 
6:10 - Created `arithmetic.add` and `arithmetic.sub` methods (each with an airty of two 'num1' and 'num2')
6:15 - If statement to prevent an invalid entry.
6:30 - `arithmetic.add` and `arithmetic.sub` now take in two numbers each and outputs their sum and their difference.
7:50 - All tests passing.
